# Kontry_UIKit


## Kontry - Made By UIKit
This is an iOS application that enables user to list all countries and display more details about them like capital, region, population, and their location on the map.

It does this by communicating with [RestCountries API](http://www.restcountries.com/) for country details, and with [FlagPedia API](https://flagpedia.net/) for country flags.

## Motivation
This is a learning project, and I built it to practice iOS development for my career.
